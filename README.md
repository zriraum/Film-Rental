# Film-Rental
This project is based on a film rental store's database. The schema consisted of 14 tables of data, containing info about films, actors
customers, stores, staff, payments, film categories etc. The tables in the database are interrelated, which allows to run complex 
SQL queries for data analysis using concepts such as joins, subqueries, window functions, views etc. to derive meaningful 
insights from the dataset for the film rental store for understanding their customers and business better.
